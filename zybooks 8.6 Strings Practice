#Task 1

#Complete the function to print the first X number of characters in the given string

# Complete the function to print the first X number of characters in the given string
def printFirst(mystring, x):
# Student code goes here
 
# expected output: WGU
printFirst('WGU College of IT', 3)    
 
# expected output: WGU College
printFirst('WGU College of IT', 11)

#Solution:
def printFirst(mystring, x):
    print(mystring[0:x])           #0:x starts at the beginning and stops at x
 
# expected output: WGU
printFirst('WGU College of IT', 3)    
 
# expected output: WGU College
printFirst('WGU College of IT', 11)


#Task 2

#Complete the function to return the last X number of characters in the given string

# Complete the function to return the last X number of characters
# in the given string
def getLast(mystring, x):
# Student code goes here
  return mystring[-x:]               ##Was printing 'None' because initially I had two print functions. Return gets around that. -x: starts counting from the back.
 
# expected output: IT
print(getLast('WGU College of IT', 2))
 
# expected output: College of IT
print(getLast('WGU College of IT', 13))

#Task 3
# Complete the function to return True if the word WGU exists in the given string
# otherwise return False

    if 'WGU' in mystring:
        return 'True'

# expected output: True
