#Assign sub_lyric with 'cow' by slicing rhyme_lyric from start_index to end_index. 
#Sample output from given program:

#cow

start_index = 4
end_index = 7
rhyme_lyric = 'The cow jumped over the moon.'
#Initially I put in [4:7] as my solution but the programd didn't return 'jumped' when it ran.
#The solution was as simply as [start_index:end_index] because they already had values associated with them. 
sub_lyric = rhyme_lyric[start_index:end_index]
