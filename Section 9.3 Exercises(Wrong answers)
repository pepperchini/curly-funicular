#Write a loop to populate user_guesses with num_guesses integers. 
#Read integers using int(input()). 
#Ex: If num_guesses is 3 and user enters 9 5 2, then user_guesses is [9, 5, 2]. 
#BREAKTHROUGH!!! The range() function is used on num_guesses because that is how we keep the user from entering more or less guesses than we want them to.
