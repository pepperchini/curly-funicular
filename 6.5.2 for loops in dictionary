#Write a for loop to print each contact in contact_emails. Sample output for the given program:

#mike.filt@bmail.com is Mike Filt
#s.reyn@email.com is Sue Reyn
#narty042@nmail.com is Nate Arty

contact_emails = {
    'Sue Reyn' : 's.reyn@email.com',
    'Mike Filt': 'mike.filt@bmail.com',
    'Nate Arty': 'narty042@nmail.com'
}

for name, email in contact_emails.items(): #for name (refers to the information on the left side of the :), email(refers to the info on the right side of :)
	print(email, "is", name)
  
#The process above splits the dictionary into two variables which can be referenced in the print function.

#Another way to solve this is by using the placeholder % feature

for name in contact_emails: 
	print('%s is %s' % (contact_emails[name], name))
  
#By putting contact_emails[name] first it's going to pull what is on the right side of the key pair first
#Then we put ,name after that so it can pull the first key which is on the left
