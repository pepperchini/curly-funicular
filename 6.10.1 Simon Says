"Simon Says" is a memory game where "Simon" outputs a sequence of 10 characters (R, G, B, Y) and the user must repeat the sequence. 
#Create a for loop that compares the two strings. For each match, add one point to user_score. 
#Upon a mismatch, end the game. Ex: The following patterns yield a user_score of 4:

#simonPattern: R, R, G, B, R, Y, Y, B, G, Y
#userPattern:  R, R, G, B, B, R, Y, B, G, Y

user_score = 0
simon_pattern = 'RRGBRYYBGY'
user_pattern  = 'RRGBBRYBGY'

# i in range len means we're breaking the string down into a list which can be compared one character at a time
for i in range(len(simon_pattern)):
    if user_pattern[i] == simon_pattern[i]: # searches for exact match i between the two strings
        user_score += 1
    else:
        break

print('User score:', user_score)
