#Given positive integer num_insects, write a while loop that prints that number doubled up to, but without exceeding 100. 
#Follow each number with a space. Ex: If num_insects == 8, print:

#8 16 32 64
#I had the correct formula but in the wrong order. I should've put the print statement first so that it started printing at 8.
#Without that my code was outputting 128 even though I told it to stop at anything over 100
#Also don't forget to put the end = " " in there so that your numbers come out horizontally instead of vertically

num_insects = 8

while num_insects <= 100:
    print(num_insects, end = ' ')
    num_insects *= 2
