#Write a while loop that prints from 1 to user_num. Sample output for the given program:

#1
#2
#3
#4

#Initially I made the while loop like this: while user_num >= i:
#However that caused an infinite loop. I think because i wasn't being updated after each loop.
# There are several ways to solve this problem 

i = 1
user_num = 4 # Assume positive

while user_num >= i: #keeps incrementing i until it reaches 4
    print (i)
    i += 1

#Another way to solve the problem
while i <= user_num:
    print (i)
    i += 1
